          Developed for a corporate client in the cyber security industry, the
          Cyber Security Escape Room is MOONHUBâ€™s first fully immersive 3D VR
          experience. Built for Oculus Quest 2 using Unity and the XR
          Interaction Toolkit, the experience challenges users to extract
          sensitive data from a virtual environment while avoiding common cyber
          threats. It was showcased at a major industry exposition, where it
          received highly positive feedback. I led the project end to end,
          designing the experience based on a real-world version operated by the
          client. My responsibilities included programming, level design, asset
          curation and modelling, animation, sound design, UI/UX, and final
          deployment. This project reflects my ability to independently deliver
          engaging, technically complex VR content from concept to completion.
