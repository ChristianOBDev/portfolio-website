  bio: `Hi, I'm Christian. I am a creative developer and ultra runner based in Liverpool, UK.
  I love running. You can often find me pounding pavement, chasing trails, and racking up laps on the track. I run everything from the mile to the 50 miler, and have aspirations to go further soon.
  I also love building things. I'm a proponent of XR technologies, and believe in the power of immersive experiences for education, training, and entertainment. I am also a game designer and developer, primarily using Unity and C#. I have recently trained as a web developer in order to bring some of my game ideas to life on the web, so be on the lookout for them soon!`,
